# Layer Distance Classifier README

## Overview
This script is designed to analyze POSCAR files using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to determine and classify distances between atoms within the same z-layers of a crystal structure.
It groups these distances based on a specified tolerance, allowing for detailed examination of atomic arrangements and potentially identifying significant structural features.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) package

## Installation
Ensure Python and pip are already installed on your system. You can install ASE using pip:
```bash
pip install ase
